# Replication

[TOC]

### reasons to do replication

Why replicate state/data?

* fault tolerance: prevent data loss
* data locality: have the data close to clients that need it
* diving up the work

---

Downsides of replication

* expensive machines
* have to keep replicas consistent (often)

### strong consistency

*strong consistency* (informally): A replicated storage system is *strongly consistent* if clients cannot tell that the data is replicated.

### primary backup replication

*primary backup replication*: A protocol to ensure strong consistency.

How about advantages

* fault tolerance (ðŸ˜€)
* data locality (ðŸ’©)
* diving up the work (ðŸ’©)

### chain replication

*chain replication*: propagate write, read from the tail.

How about general advantages

* fault tolerance (ðŸ˜€)
* data locality (ðŸ’©)
* diving up the work (ðŸ‘Œ)

*throughput*: number of actions per unit of time

Depending on the workload (mix of writes/reads), *chain replication* could give you better throughput than *primary backup replication*.

*latency*: time between start and end of one action

RC has worse write latency than PB, depending on chain length.

=> Trade-off between **throughput** and **latency**
